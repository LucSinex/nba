model:

1. projected minutes based on percentage of each team stat player is responsible
2. 

to start:

np.dot(W, X) + b = Y

X = percentage of team fantasy points per stat player responsible for (averaged over last 5, 10, 15, 20 etc. games)
Y = fantasy pts


things to try:
- average + max + min for each stat
- team totals
- usage percentage (acts as specific inclusion of team totals, since it is an estimated usage rage based on team totals in derived formula)
- offensive rating
- defensive rating (by team and/or position)
- position information acts as proxy for matchups in coordination with defensive rating by position
